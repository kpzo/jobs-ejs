 week 14 CTD IMPALA


Hi, I am going to submit this README only repository for assignment submission. Really, I am going to submit all assignments from here forward like this. I wasn't able to complete the work of the class. I became enthralled with making my application for the final project work. I became entirely carried away. I didn't have enough time to do all I wanted to do, but I'll be submitting the final assignments like this in hopes that .. I don't know, somehow I could still recieve a certificate. I learned a TON during this IMPALA course, and that is priceless. At worst, I will retake the course. The front end assignment got me really off track, I ended up learning and implementing a lot of React to try to get it to where I wanted it to be. I don't know, it's been a rough past month trying to whip everything together. I truly learned about myself in the process. I learned I have to make sacrifices in my life in order to complete these courses. 40hr/week in store working, plus 4 days/week single parenting.. plus time for friends and family and also my freelance photography projects.. doesn't leave much room at all for CTD. I learned about the sacrifices that need to be made for my upcoming Python Boa course... I have to cut out social activites and really isolate in a way, just to make this all work. It has taken me a while to let this sink in. Oh well! Better late than never.
